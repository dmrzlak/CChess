 This project is a two player chess game, to enact a move, press a key and then 
      select the piece that you want to move and then the cell that you want to 
      move it to. for selection after each cell prompt (piece and then the 
      location to move) press the enter key. There is functionality for moving 
      pieces, and if you do not select a valid move, you must try again. There 
      is not any functionality for check, checkmate or castling. So if you 
      commit to a move that would put you in check, you're screwed ;)
